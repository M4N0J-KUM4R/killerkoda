# The Intern's First Deploy

Welcome to the team!

Our newest intern, Alex, has just finished coding the landing page for **Project SpaceCat**. It's a simple HTML page, but Alex is stuck.

"I have the HTML file," Alex says, "but the platform team says I need to give them a 'Docker container'. I don't know what that is!"

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:
1.  Teach Alex how to explore the codebase.
2.  Create a `Dockerfile` to package the website.
3.  Run the container locally to prove it works.
