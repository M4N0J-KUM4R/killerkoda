# Life and Death of a Container

Containers are designed to be ephemeral (temporary). They start, do their job, and die.

But sometimes we need to control that lifecycle manually.
-   How do you stop a container gracefully?
-   How do you kill it immediately?
-   How do you make sure it comes back to life if it crashes?

In this lab, you will become the Master of Container Fate.
