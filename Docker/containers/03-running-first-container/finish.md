# You are Live!

You have successfully:
1.  Launched a container in the background (`-d`).
2.  Named it for easy reference (`--name`).
3.  Exposed it to the world (`-p`).

This is 90% of what running containers is all about.
Next, we will learn how to manage the lifecycle of these containers (Stop, Start, Kill).
