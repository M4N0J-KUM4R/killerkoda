# Why type when you can script?

So far, we have pulled images and run them.
But how do we make our *own* images?

We write a **Dockerfile**. It's a list of instructions that Docker follows to build an image.

Keywords we will learn:
-   `FROM`: Start with a base.
-   `RUN`: Execute a command.
-   `COPY`: Add files.
